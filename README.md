# Student-Survey-Power-BI-Report
Overview

This repository contains the Power BI Report created for the Student Survey dataset, focusing on analyzing students' spending habits across different store locations and settings. The report includes various visualizations and features to extract meaningful insights from the data.


Project Description

The project involves creating a Power BI Report to analyze student spending on various purchases like Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets, etc. The report addresses the following requirements:

Tabular Visualization: Format the Total Amount of Purchase (TAP) based on 'Store location' and 'Store setting', with color formatting based on predefined thresholds.
Matrix Visualization: Show the amount spent on Outdoor sports across different ages and 'Store setting', with color formatting for the amount spent.
Funnel Chart: Display the Total Amount of Purchase by 'Store setting' in a Funnel chart, with data labels as a percentage of the first.
Pie Chart: Show the total amount of purchase by different 'Store location' for Suburban 'Store setting' only, using filter context.
Scatter Plot and Sand Dance Plot: Analyze the relationship between Video games purchase, Outdoor sports spent, and Indoor sports spent across different age groups.
Data Access Restriction: Restrict data access for specific users based on their user mapping, allowing access only to data relevant to their assigned store setting.
Publishing and Dashboard Design: Publish the report on Power BI cloud service and design the Master Dashboard consisting of Funnel chart and scatter plots. Create a schedule refresh for six times every 4 hours for the Dashboard.
Q&A Feature: Utilize the Q&A feature of Power BI to show the average age of students and create a Donut chart for the total amount of purchases by 'Store location'.
